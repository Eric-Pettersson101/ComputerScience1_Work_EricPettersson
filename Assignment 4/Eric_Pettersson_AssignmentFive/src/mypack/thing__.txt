Submit the scratch link for your paintbrush project. Write a reflection by answering the following prompts and submit it as an inline text here.

Reflection prompts:

 What surprised you in this project? 
I was surprised by the lack of variables and logic options in scratch

 What was the challenge to complete this project?
I was challenged to find ways to have sprites communicate with eachother and I was time challanged 

 What difference did you make from the design when you actually implemented it?
I ended up changing the UI for my pencil size because having two buttens that increase and decrese 
the size of the pencil seemed too difucult.

 What are the future plans to extend the project?
I would want to finish the project first but afterward I would like to polish the projects UI and
add a save option. If possible it would be cool to have it save your drawing as a sprite.
